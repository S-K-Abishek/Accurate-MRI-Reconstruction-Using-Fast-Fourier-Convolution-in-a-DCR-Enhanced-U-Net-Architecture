# Accurate MRI Image Reconstruction Using a Fast Fourier Convolution Layer within a DCR-Enhanced U-Net Architecture

## ‚≠ê Overview
This project presents a novel deep learning architecture that enhances MRI image reconstruction accuracy by integrating **Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC)** layers within **Densely Connected Residual (DCR)** blocks inside a U-Net architecture. The model efficiently captures **global spectral features** while reducing reconstruction artifacts and computational cost, making it highly suitable for **real-time clinical applications**.

## üß† Key Features

- ‚úîÔ∏è Combines spectral-domain learning (FFC) with spatial-domain learning (DCR).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Built on a U-Net backbone with improved skip connections and dense feature reuse.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Achieves superior **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and reduced **MSE** and **inference time** over conventional models.

## ü©ª Problem Statement
MRI is a critical imaging modality for diagnosing internal body structures. However, its **slow acquisition speed**, **high noise sensitivity**, and **computational burden** hinder clinical efficiency. This project aims to solve these challenges by proposing a **hybrid deep learning model** that improves the **quality and speed** of MRI reconstruction.

## üî¨ Scope
- Reconstruct **high-quality, low-noise MRI images** from noisy or incomplete data.
- Reduce computational load and inference time.
- Adaptable to different imaging modalities (e.g., brain and knee MRIs).
